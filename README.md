## Data Workflow

1. **Data Extraction:** Raw transactional and warehouse datasets imported from Excel.  
2. **Transformation:** Cleaned, merged, and structured in Power Query.  
3. **Modeling:** Star schema built with relationships between facts (Orders, Inventory, Shipments) and dimensions (Region, Category, Supplier).  
4. **KPI Design:**  
   - `Inventory Turnover Ratio = Cost of Goods Sold / Average Inventory`  
   - `Days Sales of Inventory = 365 / Inventory Turnover Ratio`  
   - `Warehouse Utilization = (Used Space / Total Capacity) × 100`  
5. **Visualization:** KPI cards, donut charts, bar graphs, and line charts in Power BI.  
6. **Optimization:** Implemented slicers, tooltips, and color consistency (green-white palette) aligned with professional design principles.

## Insights

- Warehouse Utilization averaged **34%**, indicating available capacity for optimization.  
- Lead Times: Accessories category recorded the highest average delay (16.6 days).  
- Backorders: Fulfilled orders dominate backlog, showing efficient recovery but room for preventive planning.  
- Regional Cost Analysis: West region incurred the highest transportation cost due to category mix and delivery distances.

## Impact

This dashboard supports Continuous Improvement (CI) under IL6S loss-reduction pillars, helping operations teams to:
- Reduce lead time variance  
- Optimize warehouse space  
- Balance regional logistics cost  
- Improve overall supply reliability
